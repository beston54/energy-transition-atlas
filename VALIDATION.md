# CSV Validation Rules — practices_master.csv

This file is the **single source of truth** for CSV validation. Both the browser-side validator (`admin.html`) and the CI validator (`validate_csv.py`) must enforce these rules identically. When a rule changes here, update both implementations in the same commit.

## Header row

- Must be the first line of the file.
- Must contain exactly these 13 column names, in this order:
  ```
  id,title,url,brand,theme,topic,inf,year,country,org,desc,img,award
  ```
- Column names are case-sensitive. No extra columns, no missing columns.

## Row shape

- Every non-empty row after the header must have exactly 13 fields after RFC 4180 CSV parsing (quoted commas count as one field).
- Empty trailing lines are ignored.

## Per-field rules

| # | Column | Required | Type | Rule |
|---|--------|----------|------|------|
| 1 | `id` | yes | integer | Positive integer. Unique across all rows. |
| 2 | `title` | yes | string | Non-empty after trim. |
| 3 | `url` | yes | string | Starts with `http://` or `https://`. No whitespace. |
| 4 | `brand` | yes | string | One of: `RGI`, `OCEaN`, `Panorama`, `SL4B`. |
| 5 | `theme` | no | string | May be empty. May be comma-separated composite (e.g. `"People, Planning"`). |
| 6 | `topic` | no | string | May be empty. May be comma-separated composite. |
| 7 | `inf` | yes | string | Non-empty after trim. |
| 8 | `year` | no | integer or empty | If present: integer 1900..current-year+1. |
| 9 | `country` | no | string | May be empty. Typical values: country name, region (e.g. `Europe`, `Worldwide`). |
| 10 | `org` | no | string | May be empty. |
| 11 | `desc` | no | string | May be empty. |
| 12 | `img` | no | string | If present: starts with `http://` or `https://`. |
| 13 | `award` | yes | boolean literal | Exactly `true` or `false` (case-insensitive). |

## Error reporting

- Validators report at most the first 20 problems; stop after that to avoid noise.
- Each problem has:
  - Row number (1-based, counting the header as row 1 — so first data row is row 2).
  - Column name (from the header).
  - Short human-readable message (e.g. "must be a positive integer", "not a valid URL", "brand must be one of RGI, OCEaN, Panorama, SL4B").
- For duplicate `id`, report every duplicate row with the colliding id.

## Why two implementations?

The browser validator gives instant feedback without a round-trip; the CI validator is the last line of defence against someone pushing CSV directly via `git` without going through the admin. They share the same rules but live in different runtimes — duplication is accepted over a shared-runtime dependency.
